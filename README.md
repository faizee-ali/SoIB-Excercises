# SoIB-Excercises
This repo is contains the scripts that I used to finish the excercises for my SoIB RA interview

# Aim

1. Create a distribution map of some kind for any two species of your choice and derive some interesting inferences.
2. For a species of your choice, compare abundances between any two regions, at spatial and temporal scales of your choice and infer patterns.
3. For a species and region of your choice, create analyses/plots that demonstrate the seasonality of a species across the year and make appropriate inferences.
